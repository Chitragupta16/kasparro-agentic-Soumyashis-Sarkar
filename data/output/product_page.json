      "heading": "The Science of Targeted Brightening",
      "content": "GlowBoost utilizes a proprietary blend featuring a high concentration of stable L-Ascorbic Acid. This key ingredient penetrates the epidermis to directly inhibit the overproduction of melanin, effectively fading existing dark spots and preventing future discoloration. The result is a distinctly brighter, more uniform, and visibly revitalized complexion."

      "heading": "Core Formulation Efficacy",
      "content": "Our formula combines 15% pure Vitamin C with synergistic ingredients, including Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. Ferulic Acid stabilizes the Vitamin C, dramatically increasing its potency and shelf life, while the combination of all three provides a four-fold increase in free radical protection compared to Vitamin C used alone. This powerful trio ensures maximum efficacy and skin protection."
